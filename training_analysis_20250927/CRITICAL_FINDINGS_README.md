# üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS: Jaccard Bug Still Present in Analyzed Results

## **IMPORTANT DISCOVERY**

The analyzed training results were generated **BEFORE** the critical bug fixes were implemented:

- **Results timestamp**: September 26, 22:56 (before fixes)
- **Bug fixes implemented**: September 27, today (after these results)

## **This Means:**

### ‚ùå Results Still Show Broken Implementation
- `mitochondria_segmentation_20250926_165043`: **Uses broken Jaccard coefficient**
- `hyperparameter_optimization_20250926_165036`: **Uses broken Jaccard coefficient**
- Jaccard values ~0.07-0.09 are **meaningless and incorrect**

### ‚úÖ Bug Fixes Are Ready for New Training
The following files have been updated with critical fixes:
- `224_225_226_models.py` - Fixed Jaccard coefficient implementation
- `224_225_226_mito_segm_using_various_unet_models.py` - Improved training parameters
- `pbs_unet.sh` - Updated job script
- `pbs_hyperparameter_optimization.sh` - Extended epochs and fixed metrics

## **Next Steps Required:**

### 1. **Re-run Training with Fixes**
```bash
qsub pbs_unet.sh  # Will use fixed Jaccard implementation
```

### 2. **Expected Results After Fix:**
| Metric | Current (Broken) | Expected (Fixed) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Jaccard Coefficient | ~0.07-0.09 | **0.3-0.8** |
| Training Behavior | Premature stop at epoch 1-2 | **Proper convergence 15-30 epochs** |
| Model Performance | No actual learning | **Real segmentation capability** |

### 3. **Critical Fix Details:**

**BEFORE (in analyzed results):**
```python
def jacard_coef(y_true, y_pred):
    intersection = K.sum(y_true_f * y_pred_f)  # WRONG: multiplying probabilities
    return (intersection + 1.0) / (K.sum(y_true_f) + K.sum(y_pred_f) - intersection + 1.0)
```

**AFTER (in updated code):**
```python
def jacard_coef(y_true, y_pred):
    y_pred_binary = K.cast(K.greater(y_pred_f, 0.5), K.floatx())  # FIXED: binary thresholding
    intersection = K.sum(y_true_f * y_pred_binary)  # CORRECT: binary intersection
    return (intersection + 1e-7) / (union + 1e-7)
```

## **Analysis Report Validity:**

The generated report correctly identifies the bug and shows the fixes implemented, but the analyzed datasets still contain the broken results. The analysis serves as:

1. ‚úÖ **Documentation of the problem** and its solution
2. ‚úÖ **Proof of the bug's impact** (meaningless Jaccard values)
3. ‚ùå **Not representative of fixed performance** (need new training results)

## **Recommendation:**

**Re-run the training jobs with the fixed implementation to see the true performance improvements.**
