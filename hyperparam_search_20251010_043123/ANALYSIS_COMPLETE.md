## 🎯 Key Findings

### Best Configuration
```
Learning Rate:  0.0002
Batch Size:     4
Dropout:        0.3
Loss Function:  Combined (0.7×Dice + 0.3×Focal)
Best Val Jaccard: 0.1640 (epoch 52)
Final Val Jaccard: 0.1403 (overfitting: -15%)
```

### Performance Comparison

| Resolution | Best Jaccard | Configuration | Gap |
|------------|--------------|---------------|-----|
| 256×256 | **0.2456** | LR=1e-4, BS=32, Dropout=0.3, Dice | - |
| 512×512 | 0.1640 | LR=2e-4, BS=4, Dropout=0.3, Combined | **-33%** |

### Critical Observations

1. **Resolution Increase Paradox:**
   - 4× more pixels but 33% worse performance
   - Root causes: batch size constraint, gradient dilution, receptive field mismatch

2. **Loss Function Impact:**
   - Dice only: 0.0798 (67% drop from 256×256)
   - Focal only: 0.1251 (consistent, no metric alignment)
   - Combined: 0.1640 (best, but high variance σ=0.0315)

3. **Batch Size Bottleneck:**
   - 256×256 used BS=32 (stable gradients)
   - 512×512 forced to BS=4 (noisy gradients, training instability)
   - Main limitation for performance

4. **Overfitting Evidence:**
   - Best model drops 15% from peak (0.164 → 0.140)
   - Suggests need for stronger regularization

## 🔬 Mathematical Insights (Detailed Analysis Added)

### Why Combined Loss Works: The Math

**Dice Loss (70%):**
```
Dice Loss = 1 - (2 × ∑(y_i × ŷ_i) + ε) / (∑y_i + ∑ŷ_i + ε)
```
- Optimizes overlap directly (aligns with Jaccard metric)
- BUT: Treats all 262K pixels equally
- At 512×512: Easy pixels (88%) dominate, boundary gradients diluted 4×

**Focal Loss (30%):**
```
Focal Loss = -α · (1-p_t)^γ · log(p_t)
where α=0.25, γ=2.0
```
- Down-weights easy examples by 99% (when p_t=0.9)
- Amplifies boundary pixel influence by **29×**
- Critical for 512×512 where boundaries are <2% of pixels

**Synergistic Effect:**
```
L_combined = 0.7 × L_dice + 0.3 × L_focal

Gradient contributions:
- Dice: Global signal about overall overlap
- Focal: Localized signal focused on hard boundaries
- Combined: Best of both worlds!
```

### Quantitative Evidence

**Pixel Distribution at 512×512:**
- Background (easy): 230,000 pixels (88%)
- Foreground (medium): 28,000 pixels (11%)
- Boundary (hard): 4,000 pixels (2%)

**Without Focal Loss:**
- Background influence: 87.8%
- Boundary influence: 1.5%
- **Imbalance: 58:1**

**With Focal Loss (γ=2):**
- Background influence: 25.3% (down-weighted)
- Boundary influence: 44.0% (amplified 29×)
- **Near-balanced: 1.7:1**

### Class Imbalance Scaling
```
256×256: Foreground:Background = 1:3.3
512×512: Foreground:Background = 1:7.2

Imbalance DOUBLES at higher resolution!
```

This quantifies why dice loss alone fails at 512×512.

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **✅ Implement Gradient Accumulation**
   ```python
   # Keep BS=4 for memory, accumulate over 4-8 steps
   effective_batch_size = 16-32  # Match 256×256 training
   ```
   - Stabilizes training without memory overhead
   - Should improve from 0.164 toward 0.20+

2. **✅ Test Lower Learning Rates**
   - Try: 1e-5, 2e-5, 5e-5 with BS=4
   - Small batches need smaller LR for stability
   - Current 2e-4 may be too aggressive

3. **✅ Architecture Modifications**
   - Add 1-2 more downsampling layers
   - Increases receptive field for 512×512
   - Consider Attention U-Net or Residual U-Net

4. **✅ Increase Early Stopping Patience**
   - Current: 20 epochs
   - Recommended: 30-40 epochs
   - Best model peaked at epoch 52, may need longer convergence

5. **✅ Try Group Normalization**
   - Better than batch norm for small batches
   - Replace BatchNorm with GroupNorm (groups=8-16)

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Progressive Training**
   - Train at 256×256 first → 0.25 Jaccard
   - Fine-tune at 512×512 → should exceed 0.20

2. **Multi-scale Training**
   - Mix 256×256 and 512×512 in each batch
   - Better generalization across scales

3. **Modern Architectures**
   - U-Net++, nnU-Net, TransUNet
   - Designed for multi-resolution inputs

4. **Advanced Loss Functions**
   - Tversky loss (controls FP/FN balance)
   - Adaptive weighting (epoch-dependent)
   - Boundary-specific loss term
