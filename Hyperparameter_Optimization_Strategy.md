# Hyperparameter Optimization Strategy for U-Net Architectures

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic hyperparameter optimization strategy designed to address the training dynamics issues identified in the architecture comparison study.

## Key Findings from Previous Analysis

1. **High Learning Rate (1e-2)** caused weight oscillations around binary decision boundaries
2. **Small Batch Size (8)** increased gradient variance and training instability
3. **Binary Focal Loss** created non-smooth optimization landscapes
4. **Architecture-specific stabilization patterns** suggested different optimal hyperparameters

## Grid Search Design

### Hyperparameter Ranges

Based on analysis of training dynamics and literature review:

| Parameter | Values | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Learning Rate** | [1e-4, 5e-4, 1e-3, 5e-3] | Cover range from very conservative to original (reduced from 1e-2) |
| **Batch Size** | [8, 16, 32] | Test impact of gradient variance on stability |
| **Architecture** | [UNet, Attention_UNet, Attention_ResUNet] | Compare all three architectures under fair conditions |
| **Epochs** | 30 | Reduced for grid search efficiency while allowing convergence assessment |

### Total Experiments

**4 Learning Rates × 3 Batch Sizes × 3 Architectures = 36 experiments**

Estimated time: 36-48 hours with parallel execution

### Expected Outcomes

#### Learning Rate Effects:
- **1e-4**: Very stable but potentially slow convergence
- **5e-4**: Balanced stability and convergence speed
- **1e-3**: Moderate stability with good performance (recommended baseline)
- **5e-3**: Higher performance risk but faster convergence

#### Batch Size Effects:
- **8**: Baseline (current), high variance
- **16**: Improved stability, moderate memory usage
- **32**: Best stability, highest memory requirements

#### Architecture-Specific Predictions:
- **Standard U-Net**: Should benefit most from learning rate reduction
- **Attention U-Net**: May show improved early stability with larger batch sizes
- **Attention ResU-Net**: Expected to be most robust across hyperparameters

## Enhanced Training Features

### 1. Gradient Clipping
```python
optimizer = Adam(lr=learning_rate, clipnorm=1.0)
```
- Prevents extreme weight updates
- Particularly beneficial for high learning rates

### 2. Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling
```python
ReduceLROnPlateau(
    monitor='val_jacard_coef',
    factor=0.5,
    patience=5,
    min_lr=1e-6
)
```
- Automatically reduces learning rate when progress stalls
- Maintains training momentum while ensuring stability

### 3. Improved Early Stopping
```python
EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_jacard_coef',
    patience=10,  # Increased from 5
    restore_best_weights=True
)
```
- Longer patience to account for metric volatility
- Ensures best model weights are retained

### 4. Comprehensive Metrics Tracking

**Primary Metrics:**
- Best validation Jaccard coefficient
- Training stability (validation loss standard deviation)
- Convergence speed (epochs to best performance)
- Overfitting assessment (val_loss - train_loss gap)

**Secondary Metrics:**
- Training time per epoch
- Memory usage
- Final model size

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Performance Heatmaps
- Jaccard coefficient vs (Learning Rate, Batch Size) for each architecture
- Stability metrics vs hyperparameters
- Convergence speed analysis

### 2. Architecture Comparisons
- Performance trends across learning rates
- Stability improvements with batch size
- Optimal hyperparameter identification per architecture

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- ANOVA for hyperparameter significance
- Confidence intervals for performance metrics
- Correlation analysis between stability and performance

## Expected Results and Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Learning Rate Optimization
**Expected**: Learning rates 5e-4 to 1e-3 will show optimal performance-stability trade-off

**Prediction by Architecture:**
- **Standard U-Net**: 5e-4 optimal (needs more stability)
- **Attention U-Net**: 1e-3 optimal (can handle higher rates after attention convergence)
- **Attention ResU-Net**: 1e-3 optimal (residual connections provide stability)

### Hypothesis 2: Batch Size Impact
**Expected**: Larger batch sizes will significantly improve training stability

**Specific Predictions:**
- Validation loss standard deviation will decrease: BS32 < BS16 < BS8
- Performance differences will be most pronounced for Standard U-Net
- Memory constraints may limit BS32 effectiveness

### Hypothesis 3: Architecture-Hyperparameter Interactions
**Expected**: Different architectures will have different optimal configurations

**Key Interactions:**
- Standard U-Net: Most sensitive to hyperparameter choice
- Attention U-Net: Benefits most from larger batch sizes
- Attention ResU-Net: Most robust across all configurations

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Criteria:
1. **Stability Improvement**: >50% reduction in validation loss standard deviation
2. **Performance Maintenance**: Optimal configurations match or exceed previous best results
3. **Reproducibility**: Results consistent across multiple runs

### Secondary Success Criteria:
1. **Training Efficiency**: Reduced training time to convergence
2. **Resource Optimization**: Best performance per GPU-hour
3. **Practical Guidelines**: Clear hyperparameter recommendations for each architecture

## Implementation Schedule

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues:
1. **Memory constraints** with larger batch sizes
2. **Extended training time** for conservative learning rates
3. **Hardware failures** during long runs

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Graceful degradation**: Skip BS32 if memory issues
2. **Checkpointing**: Save intermediate results

## Post-Optimization Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Rerun original comparison** with optimal hyperparameters
2. **Extended training** (100+ epochs) for best configurations
3. **Statistical significance testing** of architectural differences

- **CPU**: 36 cores for data loading
- **Memory**: 240GB system RAM
- **Storage**: ~50GB for models and results

### Time Estimates:
- **Total wall time**: 48 hours
