# Project Proposal: DINOv3-Pretrained Encoder + Attention U-Net Decoder for Image Denoising

## 1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a **hybrid image denoising framework** that combines the **semantic feature extraction capabilities of DINOv3** with the **pixel-level reconstruction strength of Attention U-Net**. By leveraging a pretrained DINOv3 encoder, the model will utilize rich global representations learned through self-supervised learning. The Attention U-Net decoder will then reconstruct clean images from noisy inputs, guided by attention mechanisms that emphasize critical spatial and channel-wise features.

This hybrid approach aims to address limitations of traditional CNN denoising models, particularly in handling structured noise and preserving semantic structures in complex images, while retaining efficiency for practical deployment.

## 2. Objectives

* Integrate a pretrained **DINOv3 encoder** into a U-Net architecture.
* Implement **attention gates** or channel/spatial attention mechanisms in the decoder for effective noise suppression.
* Enable **end-to-end training** for image denoising, utilizing both pretrained semantic features and supervised denoising data.
* Evaluate model performance against standard benchmarks using metrics such as **PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality**.

## 3. Background and Rationale

* **DINOv3** is a state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision Transformer model capable of capturing global semantic features without labeled data.
* **Attention U-Net** excels at reconstructing images with high fidelity and can emphasize important features while suppressing noise.
* A hybrid model leverages both approaches:

  * **Global Context:** DINOv3 encoder provides rich semantic embeddings.
  * **Local Reconstruction:** Attention U-Net decoder ensures precise pixel-level denoising.
* This approach is expected to outperform traditional CNN-based denoising methods, particularly for structured or semantically meaningful noise patterns.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Data Preparation

* Collect or synthesize **noisy–clean image pairs** suitable for the target application.
* Apply **data augmentation**: rotations, flips, and intensity variations to improve generalization.

### 4.2 Model Architecture

* **Encoder:** Use DINOv3 pretrained weights as the backbone for feature extraction.
* **Decoder:** Attention U-Net architecture with attention gates applied to skip connections.
* **Skip Connections:** Bridge encoder and decoder features, refined through attention mechanisms.

### 4.3 Training Strategy

* **Loss Functions:** L1/L2 loss, SSIM loss, and optionally perceptual loss to preserve structural fidelity.
* **Optimization:** AdamW optimizer with learning rate scheduling.
* **Fine-tuning:** Freeze some encoder layers initially, then gradually unfreeze for end-to-end training.

### 4.4 Evaluation

* **Quantitative Metrics:** PSNR, SSIM, MSE.
* **Qualitative Assessment:** Visual inspection of denoised images.
* Compare against baseline models: vanilla U-Net, Attention U-Net, and DnCNN.

## 5. Expected Outcomes

* A **hybrid denoising network** capable of handling both low- and high-level noise structures.
* Demonstrated **improvement in image quality metrics** over conventional denoising CNNs.
* A modular framework that can be extended for **other image restoration tasks** (e.g., super-resolution, inpainting).

## 6. Deliverables

* Project codebase in PyTorch, modularized for encoder, attention decoder, and training pipelines.
* Documentation for **dataset preparation, model training, and evaluation**.
* Benchmark results comparing hybrid model performance with standard denoising models.
* A brief report summarizing architecture, experiments, and findings.
